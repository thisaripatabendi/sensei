2018/04/09 6:39:27 PM GMT+5:30,He is someone whom we can talk with get any problems solved with regard to subjects. He even willing to answer even though he is not teaching the subject even. He is a cool person who is actually very friendly with the students. ,"Well he do make weird jokes.He is good when if a student have any questions to ask. But when it comes to teaching he is very boring. He expects more than mentioned in the coursework specs, but doesn't tell the students( but he expects the students to know his expectations). ",I have no experience of his teaching. 
2018/04/09 6:46:42 PM GMT+5:30,I didn't get him as a lecturer for any of the modules I followed but he tutored for our SDP 2 tutorials in level 4. He was very supportive in those tutorial sessions and thoroughly checked that everyone was following the tutorials.,He is good at teaching and quite funny in the lectures. But for some course contents he was not quite well synchronized with the students and we could not keep up with his speed resulting for us to fall back.  ,I have no experience with this lecturer. 
2018/04/09 6:59:41 PM GMT+5:30,Very knowledgeable and convivial personality. He is easy going and won’t mind if you don’t come to lectures as long as you do work on time. He is strict but totally fair on marking.,Has a vast knowledge in many areas. Seems like a nice enough person. He expects high standards for his courseworks and assignments. He’s a strict and fair marker.,Have not personally had experience with him but haven’t heard anything bad about him from other students. So I assume he is a decent lecturer.
2018/04/09 7:06:45 PM GMT+5:30,He is explaining very well. And he thinks about students and consider about the level of speed when teaching. He is kind and helps the students when needed. When marking also he is not taking any ones side. ,"The way he teaches is quite good, he takes examples and teach in a attractive manner. But sometimes he is too fast when teaching. You need to be super fast to catch up things. He just want to finish up the schedule for the day. He answers the questions well. When marking he is bias that is too bad. Personally I don't like him because of that. ",I haven't learn from him as he is a new lecturer.
2018/04/09 7:13:20 PM GMT+5:30,"He handled my optional subjects very well. He has a definite passion for the subject, and has gone above and beyond many times to improve the learning experience of those who took his subjects. He hands out assignments well in time, and is fair in his grading.","He has excellent technical knowledge, and is always open to instructing students in any issues they bring to him. His homework assignments cover all of the relevant material covered. The graded assignments are usually quite difficult, and can be near impossible to complete if procrastinated on. However, he grades fairly and provides plenty of constructive criticism to improve upon in the future.","He has a great deal of knowledge in his specialist area, and does his best to make his lessons engaging for all students. He also is receptive to information volunteered by members of the class, and he takes an interest in your performance in other subjects as well."

a great amount of personal effort and interest to your daily teaching activities, as well as to your students. As
one would expect, student evaluations of his teaching remain very high in all categories. This past year his

implementation of this new course contributed significantly to its success. Above all, He remains open and
receptive to comments and suggestions as to how his teaching can grow and improve.
