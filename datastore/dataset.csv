Academic,Subject,Review
James Helfrich (4.1),Computer Science,"His class was awesome,the courses done by him are awful. They are all reading+quiz class with little knowledge that can be used outside school."
James Helfrich,Computer Science,"He's a really tough grader. While most professors care more if the program passes testBed, he seems to care more about how it looks. He teaches very general concepts. He's always willing to help outside of class. I feel readier for the industry because of his class."
James Helfrich,Computer Science,"A great guy. A little quirky maybe, but a great guy nonetheless. I had to work my butt off to get a good grade in this class, but it was worth it. He is a tough grader but he is also very fair. If you prove to him that youre willing to work hard, he will help you. "
James Helfrich,Computer Science,"An awesome teacher, but I have not enjoyed his upper level classes. They're far too academic and lack practical application."
James Helfrich,Computer Science,"Questions are hard to answer/impossible to find. Quizzes just become a game of guess and check. Take it in person if you can, otherwise it'll be a miserable class."
James Helfrich,Computer Science,"His lectures are very clear; if you don't understand what he's teaching and ask a question, he'll make sure you understand it before moving on. However, if you need him outside of class, I wouldn't recommend him. He's not very personable on a one-on-one basis, is very offish. Funny lectures though."
James Helfrich,Computer Science,Great. I didn't regret taking him as my supervisor. The assignments were long and hard but he was a huge help. He is very vigilant on the class forums and is very on top of things. He grades fairly and gives great feedback. I understood exactly what I got docked for.
James Helfrich,Computer Science,The assignments where kind of hard but very long. If you go and see him in his office he can really explain concepts and help with assignments.
James Helfrich,Computer Science,"He is always cracking jokes and keeping the class interesting. I learned a lot of useful things that were necessarily in the textbook in class, and he was always around and really helpful when I needed to ask questions."
James Helfrich,Computer Science,"Loved this class. Very knowledgeable. You must do the homework before class to pass this class. It can be hard, so use a tutor. Once you do the homework he goes over it in class. I think you learn a lot. He is also hilarious."
James Helfrich,Computer Science,I liked the class. The tough parts were that you finish the homework on your own before he teaches anything about it. Also the projects become pretty difficult. If you put in the time then you've got a solid grade. Super helpful outside class.
James Helfrich,Computer Science,"He is a tougher teacher, but you learn so much more from him. He doesn't just help you understand the HOW but also the WHY of coding. He literally wrote the textbook."
James Helfrich,Computer Science,"He's very funny entertaining & he knows how to teach CS material more clear than anyone at the school. Go to his office for clear, concise help. If looking to learn CS very well, choose Him."
James Helfrich,Computer Science,"He teaches very methodically, so get ready to do all that you can so that you can pass the class. He expects you to read from the textbook because every single assignment he requires is from it, and it is essential for a passing grade. If you don't like his routine, the class will be very hard to pass."
James Helfrich,Computer Science,"He wrote the textbook, he knows way more than the other CS professors. The only thing is that he has you do the assignments THEN talks about how to do the assignments. But he knows so much and is so good at explaining."
James Helfrich,Computer Science,He is one of the best teachers I have ever taken classes from. He will give you a valuable leg up in C++ and help you to understand concepts that a lot of the other teachers leave out. His courses are harder than the other CS teachers but are absolutely worth it.
James Helfrich,Computer Science,"Be ready to receive many 0s for your hard work, high responsibility, and devotion to the course, if you take him. He was my favorite teacher last semester, not anymore. He behaves himself differently in different classes."
James Helfrich,Computer Science,He is amazing!! By far the best professor I have ever had. You won't regret taking his course! He is fun to watch and sure patient with his students. He has hard assignments but it's SO worth it because you learn so much!
James Helfrich,Computer Science,"He is a hard teacher, which means that you'll learn a lot. Don't take a heavy class load when you take his class. The projects are super easy if you use tutors and they are 60% of your grade. If you start losing it, talk to him and he'll help you. Probably the most energetic teacher on campus."
James Helfrich,Computer Science,"He is amazing!! He knows what he is talking about and shares a lot of useful examples from his time working with Mircrosoft. If he makes a mistake and you catch it he is humble enough to make it funny and doesn't argue. If he was right, he takes the opportunity to teach you and everyone else why it's a common mistake."
Rick Neff (3.0),Computer Science,"Material is cryptic and unclear. Good luck trying to figure out how to turn in home work. He is a believer in public humiliation, so be sure to never be even a second late to class, and be prepared to be treated like an imbecile if you ask a question that he deems to be irrelevant or obvious."
Rick Neff ,Computer Science,"He is one of the worst teachers the facility has. He wrote his textbook, which, just like his teaching, is so cryptic you will have to literally read his mind to understand it. He isn't very helpful considering he acts like all questions are stupid."
Rick Neff ,Computer Science,"His classes are hard his instructions, book, and assignments can be confusing. That being said, I think he's an amazing teacher he's very accessible outside of class and wants to help you succeed. See him twice a week during his office hours and you'll get an A."
Rick Neff ,Computer Science,Accessible outside of class and helpful.
Rick Neff ,Computer Science,Taking his class is like trying to climb a mountain while using only your fingernails. His classes are very nonsensical. Expect 50 problems a week requiring over 14 hours to complete. You will learn nothing. Do not take his class. Goodbye GPA.
Rick Neff ,Computer Science,"He is not the most organized teacher and sometimes his assignments seem pretty bizarre. Nonetheless, the best piece of advice I can give is try to go to his office hours and try to be his friend. Neff is an incredibly kind person."
Rick Neff ,Computer Science,"He's not very fair or clear when it comes to grading. Nonetheless, He is very kind and nine times out of ten i didn't regret going to his Office. In fact, you really have to go out of your way if you want a good grade in this class."
Rick Neff ,Computer Science,"His class almost feels hopeless. Like there is no chance of getting an A. My honest reaction to most of the quiz questions has been complete befuddlement. He's a nice guy, but I would never take his class again."
Rick Neff ,Computer Science,"His first assignment gave me a picture of a bear and asks ""What does this picture have to do with discrete math""? What do I even do?"
Rick Neff ,Computer Science,"In his attempt to make people think, he comes off as vague and confusing. The class requires you take a couple C++ classes beforehand but uses Lisp which he expects you to learn on your own. He also doesn't want you to get help from former students except the tutors. Most students only passed because the tutors were there telling them what to do."
Rick Neff ,Computer Science,Be prepared to try and read his mind. he wrote the textbook which is hard to follow. When you ask for clarifications you get his abbreviated answers. Hard to follow. This class is learning to run and take flight before you can barely crawl. Hardest class I've ever taken!
Rick Neff ,Computer Science,"The point of this is class is to make you learn how to think, and so it will be difficult. Brother Neff will make you work for that knowledge, but it will be worth it."
Rick Neff ,Computer Science,"He was awesome. His class was really hard, but without him I wouldn't have been inspired to learn more about deep computer science topics such as lisp, c, cryptography, graphs, recursion, emacs, and implementing my code using more math! I would highly recommend his class. Not to mention that he loves open source software, that is always a plus."
Rick Neff ,Computer Science,"He knows his stuff but is bad at teaching it. He expects you to teach yourself everything. He wrote his own text book that is very cryptic. He constantly uses Three Letter Acronyms to teach, but doesn't explain what they mean. It is up to the student to read his mind and figure out what you are expected to learn and teach it to yourself."
Rick Neff ,Computer Science,"Lectures are strewn with vague details and depth that goes beyond most student's understanding. He is really a genius, but the worst teacher ever. He doesn't/can't convey lessons clearly. His ""textbook"" is self-written, and a total joke. He will humiliate you in front of the class to make himself look better."
Rick Neff ,Computer Science,"He inspires me to be not only a better student, but also a better Christian, and a better human being. He truly wants you to learn, not just to pass his class, but to be someone in the future. Forget about the grade, and focus on becoming the best version of yourself that you can. Just see a little beyond school and grades; you will love him!"
Rick Neff ,Computer Science,Don't take this teacher. I didn't learn anything from him. I understand programming but it wasn't because of him. Tough class and you will spend a lot of time out of class. I think the online class is better because in class you waste too much time learning nothing. He is very helpful but you need to ask him.
Rick Neff ,Computer Science,"He is a good teacher who knows where the help is and helps you find it. If you keep up with the work the class is really easy, I had no programming experience programming an yet no trouble getting an A- but an A+ is easily attainable."
Rick Neff ,Computer Science,"Vague and complicated lectures. You must go to his office for help and clarity, he will always be willing to help."
Rick Neff ,Computer Science,"His classes are not push overs. That goes to say however that you must be wiling to participate and seek help outside of class. He's always willing to help you, but he won't just give you the answers. Tests are tough, assignments are confusing, but if you put the time in to ask him what to do, he'll put you on the right path."
Scott Ercanbrack (3.0),Computer Science,"He's pretty good. He gives good feedback on assignments and is accessible outside of class. During his lectures, he doesn't answer questions very well, but if you find him outside of class he does a pretty good job. I liked having him as a professor."
Scott Ercanbrack ,Computer Science,"He seriously doesn't know what he's doing. For sure, he knows it better than the students taking his class, but he says just about every other class that he doesn't actually use these languages much. Also, the content hasn't been updated, bunch of broken links on the reading sheet."
Scott Ercanbrack ,Computer Science,"Got the distinct impression he doesn't care if you understand or not. Sure, you'll end up understanding if you go to class, but if every person showed up and already understood from the reading, he'd never know it - he just goes through the motions. Also, not good at answering questions."
Scott Ercanbrack ,Computer Science,"Not always the greatest at at answering questions, but explains topics well and clearly."
Scott Ercanbrack ,Computer Science,He's okay. He'll answer your questions if you ask him. He's been out of the industry for a while so he's not up to date on all of the latest and greatest things but he knows the things he teaches. He gets frustrated when he doesn't or when students don't understand.
Scott Ercanbrack ,Computer Science,"Data Structures is a hard class, and he doesn't make it harder, but he also isn't much help sometimes. He understands the concepts very thoroughly, so if you can follow his lectures it's great. However, he doesn't always understand students' questions, and answers what he thinks their question was instead, which can cause confusion."
Scott Ercanbrack ,Computer Science,"Tough grader, marks off for seemingly small mistakes, lectures are the worst- he talks about the material but doesn't explain how to use it at all. The textbook is bad, teaching is bad, and the professor is easily annoyed by questions, will not take again."
Scott Ercanbrack ,Computer Science,Does not explain things well at all. Gives long lectures about the history of different aspects of html and the internet that are clearly outdated information.
Scott Ercanbrack ,Computer Science,"The class is not easy but it's worth it. He is a helpful teacher, and knows his stuff. Go to him with questions, he will help you out."
Scott Ercanbrack ,Computer Science,"He obviously cares about the subject matter and the students, he just isn't a very good teacher. Although attendance is required, don't expect to learn anything from the lectures. Not recommended."
Scott Ercanbrack ,Computer Science,"This class is tough. He can be confusing but the material is also tough to understand. Expect to spend, at least, five hours a week outside of class."
Scott Ercanbrack ,Computer Science,"Not a bad teacher, not a good teacher. He's a tough grader. His feedback is usually helpful for improving future assignments. He teaches the very basics, but no real techniques. You'll feel like you're in deep water often. I recommend getting used to html/css on codeacademy before."
Scott Ercanbrack ,Computer Science,"If you talk to him after class, he is extremely helpful. In class though, his lectures are usually pretty bland. If you take the 10+ hours every week, you will most likely complete all the assignments. Nonetheless, his test was hard. It was all covered material, but you needed to have solid remembrance of very specific algorithms."
Scott Ercanbrack ,Computer Science,He isn't very clear when he teaches new concepts and tools. He tends to teach small bits of needed information and leaves out how to implement them properly.
Scott Ercanbrack ,Computer Science,"The tests are all multiple choice. You just need to do the reading and do your homework on time, so that you do not fall behind. He will be more lenient with late homework, and easy tests. Do not fall behind with your homework, or you will feel the stress. Great class."
Scott Ercanbrack ,Computer Science,"Very good professor. His tests are extremely hard, and he will do his best to make all questions very hard, so that you can study and pass them. He is an amazing teacher, with a great skills."
Scott Ercanbrack ,Computer Science,"Class is challenging for anyone, but the book he chooses it better then any other CS teacher's choice. It makes things clear and easy to do. Class should not be missed, also make sure you study hard for tests and if you need help you have to go to him, otherwise he will not offer help. Very strict and dry, but nice guy just get used to him."
Scott Ercanbrack ,Computer Science,"Great guy , always willing to take some extra time to help out and answer your questions. Gets an answer for you if he doesn't already know. Good feedback."
Scott Ercanbrack ,Computer Science,"Perhaps not the most entertaining, but knows his stuff. He doesn't waste your time with programming silly games. But teaches useful programming concepts and principles."
Scott Ercanbrack ,Computer Science,"I thought he was awesome. I got a little bored with the lectures. Give him respect, and give his class the effort it deserves, and you'll love him."
Ronald Jones (3.7),Computer Science,"Good. Not great, not awful. Cares about the students. Quiz every day about the reading - most often, you just have to skim the reading.. Gives you all the tools you need. Gives opportunities to make up late work."
Ronald Jones,Computer Science,"He's really boring and I'll be honest, I fell asleep in some of his lectures! He's nice, but very by the book, so if you try anything new, he won't really like it. His lectures are just really boring and aren't always clear. Overall, he was ok, but definitely not the best teacher I've had."
Ronald Jones,Computer Science,"Too many assumptions in this class. It is assumed you understand the reading and if you don't, here is an unspecific lecture on how it works. Each test has harder questions than the homework and if you don't pass the tests, you're grade suffers. The test questions are terribly worded."
Ronald Jones,Computer Science,"He is a rather dry guy, and can be rather monotonous, but you can totally joke around in the class, and he plays off of it. He teaches very clearly, just make sure you're on top of homework. He's very understanding with late assignments and will always try to give you the best grade possible."
Ronald Jones,Computer Science,He is an excellent teacher he is passionate about the topic and will help you as best he can. He really cares about your learning but holds you accountable for your own learning.
Ronald Jones,Computer Science,"His class is very structured, so there are no surprises. He is extremely helpful outside of class. He gives daily reading quizzes, but they aren't hard. Some of the labs will take up a lot of your time, so make sure you aren't taking other heavy classes. Overall a great teacher."
Ronald Jones,Computer Science,"He is my favorite teacher in the department. He just explains things incredibly well. And he has a great off-beat sense of humor. Labs, homeworks, and tests were all fairly challenging but they were all very fun. I enjoyed the entire course. It's been among my favorites."
Ronald Jones,Computer Science,He's a nice guy. But he can be pretty dry and hard to listen to too long. His class requires doing a lot of reading inbetween the lectures. The big thing though is that every week there'll be a lab to work on. Which means be prepared to go in when you're free. Probably biggest hassle is the tests.
Ronald Jones,Computer Science,"Very monotone, and a lot of reading but you come out understanding what you are taught"
Ronald Jones,Computer Science,"He is a great professor, extremely kind, and very fair when it comes to grading. The topics he teaches aren't always the easiest, but if you do the readings, homework, labs, and projects you will pass the tests. He has been going away from full write-on tests, and making all of his tests multiple choice. Study ahead and you will do fine."
Ronald Jones,Computer Science,"I'm surprised less people have mentioned how difficult the final project was. Most people don't even complete it. HW is also time consuming. If you're cautious, I guarantee you can get 100% on every single HW."
Ronald Jones,Computer Science,This class was horrible. Homework is hard and covers stuff not really gone over in class and not much help online. It would be like a teacher teaching you to add then giving you multiplication homework. We would ask him in class to go over homework and he wouldn't. He even admitted a few times that he was teaching poorly.
Ronald Jones,Computer Science,"Homework is super tough unless you read a lot. I worked really hard and some assignments I got 100s and some I got 30s. Other than that, the class is pretty awesome. He has a dry but really good sense of humor. Good class, I would definitely take it again."
Ronald Jones,Computer Science,"Wicked hard class, lots of programming. I can promise if you give it your all and talk with him on harder projects and homework, he will ALWAYS be there to help you."
Ronald Jones,Computer Science,Great course from a great teacher. Teaches clearly and is more than willing to help if you are stuck or lost. The labs and in class lessons were amazing and I learned a ton. The book could be a lot better though.
Ronald Jones,Computer Science,He is a really great teacher. He is always available to help students in his office and really understanding when it comes to late HW.
Ronald Jones,Computer Science,"He means well and is a very nice man, however his teaching method just didn't fit my learning style. He isn't very engaging. Way too much info for true beginners like myself. There needs to be something more basic. As it stands way too much is crammed into the course."
Ronald Jones,Computer Science,"He is an AMAZING TEACHER! This is the best class I have had in a long time. We learned really interesting material, he's hilarious if you understand intelligent humor! He is always willing to help. Come to class, do the labs and you'll be set!"
Ronald Jones,Computer Science,"Genius and hilarious if you understand his humor. Really helpful but can be difficult to approach. If his students are boring, he'll let the class be boring. If his students are fun, then prepare yourself for a really entertaining class."
Ronald Jones,Computer Science,"His lectures are clear, there is a clear progression of information. He is approachable and can answer questions when you need them. Dry sense of humor."
 Luc Comeau (4.3),Computer Science,"Really good sense of humor. Probably easier than others, but you will learn a lot from him. His classes were one often highlight of my day."
 Luc Comeau ,Computer Science,Very thoughtful and helpful when needed. His classes are great. You can understand every lecture and get a grade if do the homework and projects properly.
 Luc Comeau ,Computer Science,"Great teacher! Would highly recommend. Lenient on assignments, fun to talk to, will help outside of class. Just stay on top of your assignments and youll be fine."
 Luc Comeau ,Computer Science,"Fantastic teacher! Must read course material and complete assignments before the next class, but it is a great way to prepare you for the lecture. He is very understanding, and knows the material well. Great Teacher and would recommend."
 Luc Comeau ,Computer Science,"He's super funny, and very lenient when it comes to late assignments. Highly recommended."
 Luc Comeau ,Computer Science,Hands down one of the best Professors around. He uses humor naturally and teaches well. He never turns away a question.
 Luc Comeau ,Computer Science,"The guy is awesome. He was such a great teacher. I was not disappointed. From what I hear, he may even be in the top best teachers in the department. If you can, take him!"
 Luc Comeau ,Computer Science,"This class is a mess. Nothing is taught, only assigned for reading. The book can be extremely cryptic and many lessons are out of order. If you are stuck on a specific topic, no help will be offered outside of tutoring and to do that you must anticipate your questions days in advance."
 Luc Comeau ,Computer Science,"He is the man! he is an amazing CS professor, I transfer from another school where I pretty much taught myself how to program, He was so helpful and his lectures were great! I really learn a lot and became a way better programmer, the Homework is a lot but it actually helps you so much to learn the concepts, the projects are hard."
 Luc Comeau ,Computer Science,He doesn't solve your homework for you if you're stuck but he'll help you think the right way to help you solve the problem. I found this really helpful. He's super patient too. He's good at helping students see real life application of programming concepts.
 Luc Comeau ,Computer Science,"I love him, his classes are very laid back and fun to go to. He is very knowledgeable and experienced. He's very entertaining and funny and a great teacher. I'd highly recommend him."
 Luc Comeau ,Computer Science,"Hands-down my favorite teacher so far. I did get a poor grade, but that was entirely, 100% on me. there was more than enough extra credit offered to mitigate that. He is great at answering questions in a way that is understandable and relatable, and a lot of fun to listen to in class."
 Luc Comeau ,Computer Science,He's a great teacher that will try to explain everything as simply and relatable as possible. He is very lenient and caring when it comes to grading and you can tell he tries to make things as accessible as possible.
 Luc Comeau ,Computer Science,"You can work ahead as far as you like, and you get extra credit for doing that. So I was able to do homework a week or two ahead when I had time, and then focus on other classes. Easy class, funny professor, and overall a great class."
 Luc Comeau ,Computer Science,This person is really funny. However the course is pretty hard and its mainly just how you see it. Very rarely does he help you with your assignments.
 Luc Comeau ,Computer Science,"Homework assignments are enjoyable and fairly easy, just take a lot of time to figure out. Good teacher and very helpful. Nice guy."
 Luc Comeau ,Computer Science,"I was very satisfied with both times I took him. You have to do the assignments and learn the material before he actually teaches the material, but he teaches it really well. I enjoyed having him as a teacher. I'd Recommend him."
 Luc Comeau ,Computer Science,He is the best teacher you can hope when starting with computer science classes. He's hilarious and easy to talk to.
 Luc Comeau ,Computer Science,"Great teacher, would highly recommend if you are a beginning programmer."
 Luc Comeau ,Computer Science,"He likes to review the assignment the class AFTER it is due. He expects you to learn from the book. However, he usually spends a lot of time in the Linux Lab helping out his students."
Jinwoo Kim (3.1),Computer Science,All he does is read off the power points. He doesn't show you how to program at all in the class but expects you to do programming projects on your own.
Jinwoo Kim ,Computer Science,"Extremely hard content and difficult concepts but Professor Kim breaks it down really well. He wants to see you participate, do all the homework, show up and give it your best. Work as hard as you can relentlessly and you will be rewarded."
Jinwoo Kim ,Computer Science,Tough but worth it if you can follow him.
Jinwoo Kim ,Computer Science,Simply best professor I have had... Hard class but I learned a lot!
Jinwoo Kim ,Computer Science,Hard and demanding but explains the topics and ideas in depth and if you go to class and take notes and pay attention to what he stresses you will do well. There are easier professors for the courses he teaches but I guarantee you will not learn as much from the other professors as you will from him.
Jinwoo Kim ,Computer Science,"His way of explaining the topics can be somewhat confusing but uses some very good examples to explain it. His tests are hard and final even harder, but if he sees that you tried and did all of your homework's and projects."
Jinwoo Kim ,Computer Science,"He is quite knowledgeable and can answer to many questions. His way of teaching may not fit for all, but I personally can say that I learned a lot from him. His tests are very hard, however if you pay enough attention and do his homeworks and projects, you should be ok. If you want to really learn, he is the best way to go!"
Jinwoo Kim ,Computer Science,He is not an easy Professor at all. However if you would like to learn and actually feel like going to 4 year college then he is one of the best options to pick! He definitely touches every topic. His exams are ridiculously hard.
Jinwoo Kim ,Computer Science,"Extremely tough Professor. Test are ridiculously hard. If you take only his course in one semester you still may not able to get A in his class, simply because he makes already hard courses even harder. Lectures are all based on slides and nothing else."
Jinwoo Kim ,Computer Science,Hard class. I found myself sleeping half way through class most of the time. Tough grader.
Jinwoo Kim ,Computer Science,"If you know what you are doing, he is a great prof. Otherwise forget about it. Material covered ranges from text book to beyond and I got a great semester."
Jinwoo Kim ,Computer Science,He may know his stuff but does not know how to articulate his thoughts very well. His exams are unfair and based on items that are not deemed on a high priority level given that there is a lot of material to read. Many of his students fail through no fault of their own and then he tries to curve it. This to me is not a wise way.
Jinwoo Kim ,Computer Science,"What a great professor! I took 2 programming classes with him and he never fails. Make sure you do your homework because similar things you'll get on your Midterm and Final. Pay attention to class and participate, it will make a difference on your grade."
Jinwoo Kim ,Computer Science,"He knows his stuff. He's a pretty good professor. Lessons are posted, homeworks are long and hard. Test are hard also."
Jinwoo Kim ,Computer Science,"Tough class. He will emphasis on the key topics which is good. His homeworks and assignments are hard and take some time. When it comes to test, its usually what was on the homework/slides. Hes also extremely knownledgable in Computer Science."
Jinwoo Kim ,Computer Science,Doesn't really teach.. he only talks about his slides and he expects students to understand the material without even explaining it first. he told us that our midterm project was for graduate level.
Jinwoo Kim ,Computer Science,"Great ""TEACHER""! he tends to repeat his explainations of math problems, which somehow stick to your head, so when you attack the problems you'll remember what he said.He knows his stuff, Just follow through the lectures and do problems on your own time."
Jinwoo Kim ,Computer Science,"He is a good professor. His lessons are well organized since he gives the most important notes straight from the textbook. In addition, he applies modern examples to math. Also, he takes one to two days in grading the test exams. Overall, a decent professor that explains the material, but you need to review after."
Jinwoo Kim ,Computer Science,I personally think he's unfair with test grading. He goes to fast way to fast.
Jinwoo Kim ,Computer Science,Lots of things to do but I learned a lot.
TJ Sunderland (3.9),Computer Science,One of the best professors . Only thing will stress you out the 27 pages paper but he will prepare you throughout the semester. You will learn a lot of new things in his class. He loves teaching and always understands his students.
TJ Sunderland ,Computer Science,Great person!! Funny and with lots of patience although he might be a bit confusing when explaining things. He is definitely one of my favorite professors because of his positive attitude and the fact that he's considerate to your GPA.
TJ Sunderland ,Computer Science,He is funny and keeps the class entertained but is not clear with his assignments. The final paper was a 20+ pg paper but it was most of the work we had been doing all semester. I'd take him again if I was given the option.
TJ Sunderland ,Computer Science,Amazing great man! But when it comes to teaching hes terrible!! Way too much work 30-40 pg paper at the end and he keeps on assigning more work its too much!
TJ Sunderland ,Computer Science,He is a nice and funny guy but he is not a good professor in my opinion. Me and some other students dropped his class because we were confused. He wants you to write two 20-25 papers and he is not clear on what he wants. I was able to understand him.
TJ Sunderland ,Computer Science,"He knows his stuff. There are two papers, two textbooks, and chapter questions."
TJ Sunderland ,Computer Science,"Terrible professor, no guidance. This new professor actually teaches, gives reasonable deadlines and does not inundate his students with work. Do not take him."
TJ Sunderland ,Computer Science,"Love Him, very helpful in class. Very understanding. Has a sense of humour."
TJ Sunderland ,Computer Science,"He is not a bad prof, just very unclear about his class. You dont have any homework, besides preparing for his big paper which is difficult if you are not paying attention in his class. overall good prof. I would recommed him any day"
TJ Sunderland ,Computer Science,"Cool guy and lectures are a breeze. But you have to pull effort when writing your proposals. Overall, he's a great Professor!"
TJ Sunderland ,Computer Science,Yeah this class might seem easy but it wont be and anyone who says he is the best doesnt deserve to be in grad school.
TJ Sunderland ,Computer Science,I despised him he puts two textbooks on the table at the beginning of the class and says read them and thats the last you see of them in his class..it is a waste of time he doesnt explain anything and expects you to know everything.
TJ Sunderland ,Computer Science,He is fewer of knowlegeable professors. He know his materials if you realy pay attetion and participate in his classes you will do well. Take him before no seats in the class. Student love to take him. He is very hot.
TJ Sunderland ,Computer Science,"He is a nice person, but HORRIBLE teacher. Expectations are unclear, you think you're on the right track but you get NO feedback until the very end, when it's too late to fix. Book he gives is so confusing and he has no guidelines as to what to read and what pertains to lectures."
TJ Sunderland ,Computer Science,"He is just the best. Yes, research paper is long, but if you do your assignments on time, there is no reason for you not to do well in this class. All the assignments are about your research topic. He is extremely helpful."
TJ Sunderland ,Computer Science,"Long paper, but keep up with your assignments and you'll do fine. He's a nice professor and can be helpful at times."
TJ Sunderland ,Computer Science,These guy is an amazing prof. The class is easy and he makes everything crystal clear. He is very knowledgable so use it to your advantage!
TJ Sunderland ,Computer Science,"Great Prof, very helpful regarding this class as well as advice for other issues you may have at school. Make sure you do the research for you paper thoroughly."
TJ Sunderland ,Computer Science,"Worst professor ever, the class seems easy, but he doesnt help at all. I did not learn anything from this guy n that paper was a waist of time its just bs."
TJ Sunderland ,Computer Science,"I was nervous bout taking his class cuz I herd bout this long paper, I really must stay that this class was a breeze, all u need to worry is about the paper which really isnt that bad if u dont save it all for the last min. The paper is not that hard. I had no clue what was going on most of the time."
Oluwakemi Ola (4.6),Computer Science,"Was an experienced coder coming into the class but she enhanced my learning even more. Excellent teacher, would show plenty of examples in class, explain thoroughly and always answered questions. Kept the atmosphere in lectures good too with her lighthearted jokes."
Oluwakemi Ola ,Computer Science,So good at teachinig
Oluwakemi Ola ,Computer Science,"Really good prof! Could explain coding questions over again until you understand in class! The grade was pretty high, and exams were fair! Go to her classes. Attendance matters for you to understand!"
Oluwakemi Ola ,Computer Science,Amazing prof! Was always there when I needed help! Always tried to keep the class lighthearted with a few jokes. Definitely recommend taking her as a prof!
Oluwakemi Ola ,Computer Science,She's a great teacher if you come to the class! She's passion and the class style is comfy
Oluwakemi Ola ,Computer Science,"The coding logics was much easier to understand. However, the structure of this course and the methods of evaluation makes it very easy for you to get high marks - if you do the labs + assignments well, you'll probably get 80%. Love the prof!"
Oluwakemi Ola ,Computer Science,She made programming more interesting than it is.
Oluwakemi Ola ,Computer Science,She is a really passionate Professor and really cares about the students! Her teaching is also amazing and engaging! She gives a lot of support and you can feel free to ask her any questions. Exams are good if you study ahead and the cheat sheet/review sheet helps alot!
Oluwakemi Ola ,Computer Science,"Do the labs, they are easy + worth a lot. Do the assignments in advance. They take a while but you can get an easy 100 on them. Exams are a little harder than labs+assignment so fill up your cheat sheet and do the practice coding questions."
Oluwakemi Ola ,Computer Science,"I found her approachable, helpful and encouraging, particularly outside of class. She's a great teacher, able to guide one from knowing nothing to a plane of understanding. Fair exams if you study."
Oluwakemi Ola ,Computer Science,"She teaches what is important and skips the unnecessary topics unlike several other profs, she is extremely helpful and I 100% recommend going to her office hours as she will always figure out a way to get the concept in your head."
Oluwakemi Ola ,Computer Science,"She was great. She can come off tough, but really cares for her students. I had no computer science background but wanted a beginner basis and I got exactly that. She is always willing to answer ANY questions and really cares about her students that actually go to class. Thats my biggest suggestion, GO TO CLASS and BE ENGAGED and you'll do great."
Oluwakemi Ola ,Computer Science,"She is a solid prof. In any case, it was fairly easy and she was pretty fair; her assignments and exams did not offer any surprises."
Oluwakemi Ola ,Computer Science,The professor made herself available to help and cared about my performance in the class.
Oluwakemi Ola ,Computer Science,"I was very lucky to have Prof, she really cared about the students succeeding- for her our understanding of the content always took precedence over grades. Great course, stick with it and have a will to learn."
Oluwakemi Ola ,Computer Science,She was one of the greatest professors I met. I never regretted taking her class. She is very passionate about what she was teaching and everyone in class could tell she wanted to help anyone who was struggling with lecture materials. I really hope I will have another chance to enroll her class.
Oluwakemi Ola ,Computer Science,"She was great! Very intelligent individual who is passionate about what she is doing. I came in with zero knowledge of computer science and left feeling confident and capable. She was very available for help outside of lectures and helped me truly understand the concepts we learned. She genuinely cares about her students, she is amazing!"
Oluwakemi Ola ,Computer Science,She is a pretty quirky and a fun prof.
Oluwakemi Ola ,Computer Science,"I had absolutely no coding experience. Her teaching style, desire to develop student relationship, and willingness to take that extra step to ensure everyone has a solid understanding of every concept is what helped me succeed and is what made my first coding experience an enjoyable one. Would recommend learning through her."
Oluwakemi Ola ,Computer Science,"Great lecturer! Explained things really clearly and was great at explaining concepts in simple terms. Did a really good job at answering questions clearly and logically. Also did a fantastic job at politely reminding students that this was an entry level course when try hards would ask ""questions"" to show off their previous coding knowledge."
Robert Webber (2.0),Computer Science,The actual structure of his is a bit of a mess. He posts everything online on Confluence in a hard-to-read bullet point form. Take a course with him though and you'll see that he gives out high grades like candy.
Robert Webber ,Computer Science,"Posts everything online in terribly formatted posts full of bullet points. He repeats everything he posts in class, and most of what he posts is not even on the final. The course work is a joke, and he has a program grade it, so he never looks at anything but the Git logs."
Robert Webber ,Computer Science,"He wont email you grades cause, only answers emails during office hours cause you guessed it, he doesn't think it's safe to have an internet connection at home. Oh and he doesn't lecture, you better watch lectures online."
Robert Webber ,Computer Science,"His ""teaching"" involved handing out video lectures that were 1:30 long, then made us watch the SAME video the following class. He was supposed to encourage discussion of the videos, but instead he watched them with us during ""lecture"" with his back against us, so he couldn't even see if we had questions or not. Easily the worst professor."
Robert Webber ,Computer Science,Terrible at conveying information. This man should not be a professor. Those course was awful because of him when I was actually looking forward to it.
Robert Webber ,Computer Science,"He is saying that he is good but he sucks at conveying information, his entire job is conveying information. If he sucks at that, he sucks at his job."
Robert Webber ,Computer Science,"I won't bother talking about the prof. Just make sure to study in a group, or else you will have a hard time..."
Robert Webber ,Computer Science,Unprepared before lectures. He started drawing a circuit on the board once and after 10 minutes of scribbling he gave up. Kinda sums up his teaching style. I duked it out with him once in class because of how incomprehensible he was. I regret not having complained about him. worst prof. worst grade I ever got.
Robert Webber ,Computer Science,If he was a piece of toast. He would be the worst piece of toast the world has ever seen
Robert Webber ,Computer Science,"Still now I am reminded what an awful, god awful, horrible teacher this guy was. Not only was he an insufferable old coot he had a poor grasp of his course."
Robert Webber ,Computer Science,"What on earth is he talking about!? It's impossible to figure out what's going on in this class about 90% of the time. Don't have a real textbook OR online notes. He wants to be helpful, but can't communicate. Most stressful course I've ever taken."
Robert Webber ,Computer Science,"Good prof. Nice guy, always has interesting anecdotes. Assignments were fun and relatively easy once you got the idea."
Robert Webber ,Computer Science,"I got over 90% in his course. It's hard and he's not the greatest at conveying information. However, he is a very nice guy if you actually go to his office and talk to him, and he is willing to help you."
Robert Webber ,Computer Science,It's too bad he's too paranoid to use the web.
Robert Webber ,Computer Science,"Worst professor in entire department, please someone sack this wack job! "
Robert Webber ,Computer Science,"Predicted that the internet would come to a stop because of insecurities in PDF files... Wrote a terribly buggy, slow unbelievable mess of an application for emulating hardware, forced class to use it for every assignment. Avoid this guy like Black Death."
Robert Webber ,Computer Science,"I can't think of enough bad things to say about this retard. And his course, while having assignments, were not required to be handed in until the last day."
Robert Webber ,Computer Science,"Horrible professor. is there any word worse than horrible? Rediculous amount of workload, hard exam, meaningless lecture."
Robert Webber ,Computer Science,Unbelieveable. Docked my final mark 3% for putting my name in the wrong place on a test.
Robert Webber ,Computer Science,He just seems unintrested in his topic and his evaluation methods leave much to be desired. Thus regardless of functionality no matter what there were always people failing assignments.
Kimberly Taylor (4.6),Computer Science,"I loved her! This class isn't the easiest, but she's always willing to help. Tests are in class and proctored by her. You have homework every week. She is a really good teacher though, so if you study, you shouldn't have too many problems!"
Kimberly Taylor ,Computer Science,"I have taken her for 3 courses and she is always there to help. Very understanding lectures and always glad to work it with you till you understand it. DONT wait to do programs, start when she gives them to you and go to her for help."
Kimberly Taylor ,Computer Science,She is a great person and a pretty good teacher. She'll help you if you ask. You'll have to study but it's manageable. You have projects due every week and she will help you with them if you ask.
Kimberly Taylor ,Computer Science,She was funny and made the class fun. She was very easy to understand and very helpful. She made me feel like computer science was a good choice for me!
Kimberly Taylor ,Computer Science,Super easy working with her but very time consuming. Super easy class.
Kimberly Taylor ,Computer Science,She is very helpful
Kimberly Taylor ,Computer Science,"She's helpful. You just need to pay attention to the class and use the book to study. If you don't, well, you'll probably won't do well in the class. It's a class that you must put in an effort. She'll help but you need to meet her half way. Not happy but I'll take her again."
Kimberly Taylor ,Computer Science,"She's very helpful, if you go ASK for help. I don't think she's a great teacher but, she's probably the easy going teacher. If you wanna do great for a class, read the book, go over the assignments, and understand what each line of code does. If you do struggle, go to tutoring as much as possible if you can."
Kimberly Taylor ,Computer Science,"She is great! Very helpful and fun in class. Use book a lot and will help you with programs. Tests are easy if your on top of your game. Need to go to class to understand, she explains way better than the book. Gives a quiz or program to do almost every day but you do them in class and she helps. Homework is easy if you pay attention in class."
Kimberly Taylor ,Computer Science,"Love her! Eager to help if you have questions. Most test questions come from the questions in the back of the chapter. Do the homework, go to class, and you'll do fine."
Kimberly Taylor ,Computer Science,She is so nice and very helpful! This class is pretty easy. Tests are really easy and program assignments are not too bad.
Kimberly Taylor ,Computer Science,"She is very helpful and nice. If you have any problems with your program, she will definitely help you. Her tests are straightforward, just study old programs and the book. The class isn't super easy, but its not hard either if you do your work."
Kimberly Taylor ,Computer Science,VERY EASY!!! She goes over the exact stuff the HW tells you to do. all HW is on test. Just do the reviews before the test and you will be prepared.
Kimberly Taylor ,Computer Science,She is excellent. She is very easy and really helps you out a lot. If you need to take this class I STRONGLY SUGGEST you take her. This is an easy A. All you have to do is your work. And most of it is done in class. Nothing hard about her class.
Kimberly Taylor ,Computer Science,She has the best understanding of all the concepts and great examples. She makes her examples simple to understand and uses them for labs and tests.
Kimberly Taylor ,Computer Science,One of the best prof I have ever had.
Kimberly Taylor ,Computer Science,"Awesome. Really enthusiastic and is fair to everyone. Also, she is really clear with her examples and notes. Good prof!"
Kimberly Taylor ,Computer Science,An extremely good prof. Explains everything and I mean everything in easy-to-follow clear steps. One of the best profs I ever had.
Kimberly Taylor ,Computer Science,"Very generous and kind in nature. Her notes are very important for tests and exams. She rarely uses the book, but do the exercises she gives. Extremely helpful and linient in marking."
Kimberly Taylor ,Computer Science,One of the best profs I ever had. She knows his stuff inside out. Very helpful and respectful with students. Also she's cute and humble too
